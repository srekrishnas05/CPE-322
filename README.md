## **Hi there, I'm Sre krishna Subrahamanian, a student taking CPE 322, or Computer Engineering Design VI!** ##
### I've created this GitHub Repo to showcase the labs assigned within this course! ###

The labs for this course range from python/command line programming to Django Web Development and even SQLite!
This repo will document the code used and outputs for each of the 10 labs assigned in the course curriculum.

This repository is for educational and portfolio use.
